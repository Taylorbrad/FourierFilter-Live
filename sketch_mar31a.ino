#OBJECTIVES
/*
#OB 1: Read in a simple 2 tone wave

#OB 2: Play back a wave

#OB 3: Implement a Fourier transform formula function. It takes a wave, and returns a fourier generated map of tones
#OB 4: Override the Fourier function to take a second parameter, a list of indices, which dictates which tones should be filtered out. This returns the filtered frequency instead of a map.

#OB 5: Implement function that takes two waves, sums them, and returns that sum
